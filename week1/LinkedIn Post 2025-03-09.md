I've started my journey in learning LLM Engineering by taking @Ed Donner's course on [Udemy - LLM Engineering: Master AI and Large Language Models and Agents ](https://www.udemy.com/course/llm-engineering-master-ai-and-large-language-models). 

I'm fascinated by the possibilities of this technology, but a bit unsure of the capabilities. My intuition tells me that LLMs (what others might call GenAI) have the potential to change the way we work, the same way mobile phones and email changed the way we communicate, databases changed the way we persist data, spreadsheets changed the way we account. 

I'm excited about:

- calling APIs to engage frontier models from OpenAI, Claude, etc.
- using LLMs locally on my laptop
- agentic workflows
- understand a bit more about the security implications
- and just building stuff with the guidance of an experienced LLM engineer.

I have to give a big shoutout to @IBM for making this platform available to me. I think every IBMer should take advantage of Udemy.

I first learned of @Ed Donner on the @O'Reilly [AI Catalyst Conference: Agentic Artificial Intelligence](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-catalyst-conference/9780135462027/) 

@Ed Donner was a treat to listen to, and I somehow stumbled upon his LLM Engineering course!
